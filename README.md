# AgenticAI Research Assistant  

AgenticAI Research Assistant is a cutting-edge research agent designed to streamline the research process using advanced AI tools and frameworks like Agno, LangChain, and LangGraph.  

## Features  

- **Multi-Agent Pipeline**: Automates the research workflow with a pipeline that includes:  
    - Literature search  
    - Summarization  
    - Hypothesis generation  

- **Real-Time Academic Paper Retrieval**:  
    - Integrated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with FAISS for efficient and real-time access to academic papers.  

- **Agent Orchestration**:  
    - Utilized LangGraph Studio to orchestrate agents seamlessly.  
    - Provided a Command-Line Interface (CLI) with robust logging and error recovery mechanisms.  

## Technologies Used  

- **Agno**: For building intelligent agent systems.  
- **LangChain**: To manage and chain together various AI components.  
- **LangGraph**: For visualizing and orchestrating agent workflows.  
- **FAISS**: For fast and scalable similarity search.
